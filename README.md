# Holotestoid
model for sea urchin skeleton growth and form
Orginal program was published in Abou Chakra and Stone JTB 2011

This updated version predicts height to diameter ratios as the skeleton grows and develops (by adding and increasing plate size)

Also created a visceral module that shows how changing column length, apical system and peristome relationship can affect overall urchin skeleton form..for now this is form translated to height:diamater ratios we (in colaboration with Miroslav Lovric) are working on calculating the "better" curve
